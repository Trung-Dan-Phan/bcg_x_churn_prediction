# BCG-X Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn based on historical purchasing behavior. The model is built using **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** classifiers, leveraging features such as total purchases, purchase intervals, and customer lifetime.

## Features Used
- **total_purchases**: Total number of orders made by the customer.
- **total_sales**: Total revenue generated by the customer.
- **total_quantity**: Total number of items purchased.
- **most_used_channel**: The most frequent ordering channel used (e.g., online, in-store).
- **quali_relation**: Qualitative assessment of the customer (e.g., demanding, difficult, agreeable).
- **customer_lifetime**: The number of days since the customerâ€™s first purchase.
- **avg_purchase_interval**: The average time between consecutive purchases.
- **unique_products**: The number of distinct products purchased.
- **unique_channels**: The number of different channels used by the customer.

## Installation
To set up the project, first, create a virtual environment (recommended):

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Train the model using Logistic Regression or Decision Tree.
3. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Interpret feature importance and derive insights for customer retention strategies.


## Model Performance
- **Logistic Regression** achieved **92.2% accuracy**, with high precision (96%) and recall (77%) for churned customers.
- **Decision Tree** performed slightly lower at **84.3% accuracy**, capturing fewer churners but providing an interpretable rule-based model.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by improving the model, adding new features, or optimizing the preprocessing pipeline.
